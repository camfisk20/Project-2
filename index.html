<p class="info">Water Pollution is something that has been in our world since plastic was created. Some ways are oil spills, trash being thrown in the water, acids from mines, buried chemical waste, sewage, and heat. The information I gathered from this website we do most of the damage when it comes to pollution. 

 In a site I read from it stated more than 80 percent of the worlds wastewater flows back into the environment without being treated or reused, according to the United Nations; in some least-developed countries, the figure tops 95 percent. In the United States, wastewater treatment facilities process about 34 billion gallons of wastewater per day.</p>
